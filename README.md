# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview

This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project is designed to monitor network or system activities for potentially malicious behavior. It uses Python and the `scapy` library for packet capture and analysis.

## Features

- **Packet Capture:** Captures network packets to analyze their content.
- **Rule Engine:** Implements a basic rule engine to detect suspicious activities.
- **Logging and Alerting:** Logs suspicious activities and generates alerts.
- **Network Monitoring:** Continuously monitors network traffic for potential threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies: `pip install scapy`

### Usage

```bash
python ids.py
```

Replace `"your_network_interface"` with the name of your network interface.

## Example Rules

1. **Port Scanning Detection:**
   - Detects potential port scanning activities.
  
2. **Ping Flood Detection:**
   - Detects ICMP Echo Request (Ping) floods.
